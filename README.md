# Bebop Bounty Granter
## Purpose
Decentralized handling of contract-based activity payments following their deliverables validation via reviewers and oracles.

The idea is to enable project initiators and sub-DAO/committees to propose dev projects; expressing the project deliverables and their completion conditions in on-chain contracts; having funds allocated once approved by a DAO community funding; reviewers validating the work done, which allows the grantees to unlock corresponding funds, potentially rated per the deliverables' evaluated completion level.

More details are available in the project [Wiki](./wiki).

This project is developped in the context of the [ETHGlobal Online 2022 hackathon](https://ethglobal.com/events/ethonline2022).
